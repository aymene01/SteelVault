## Motivation

SteelVolt is a passion-driven open-source project that aims to explore the world of database design and implementation using the Rust programming language. As developers, we believe that hands-on projects are one of the best ways to deepen our understanding of complex concepts. This database engine serves as a stepping stone for individuals interested in databases, distributed systems, and performance optimization.

By working on this project, we seek to:
- **Learn Database Concepts:** Dive into the intricacies of database systems, ranging from storage engines to transaction management and query optimization.
- **Master Rust Programming:** Utilize the power of Rust's safety, concurrency, and performance to build a robust and efficient database engine.
- **Experiment with Scalability:** Explore techniques for handling large datasets and devising strategies for scaling the system.
- **Promote Open-Source Collaboration:** Foster a community where developers can contribute, learn, and grow together.
- **Open Doors for Future Development:** While currently a learning project, we envision that with community contributions and dedication, this database engine can evolve into a more feature-complete and production-ready system.

**Note:** As of now, SteelVolt is primarily intended for educational purposes. It may not be suitable for production environments. However, with the collective efforts of contributors, we aim to evolve this project into a more versatile and reliable solution.

## Key Features

- High-performance storage engine optimized for read and write operations.
- Support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions.
- SQL-like query language with powerful indexing and filtering options.
- Scalable architecture suitable for handling big data workloads.
